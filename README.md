# MPC
The task of this MPC controller is to keep the pendulum upright in an inverted position. The pendulum is allowed to move horizontally, essentially making it a pendulum on a cart. The aim of this project was to learn MPC controller for a bipedal robot since a simplified mathematical model of a biped resembles an inverted pendulum.
# Requirements
```
pip install do-mpc
```
# What is an MPC ?
To know the answer to this question please visit this [link](https://github.com/Robotics-Club-IIT-BHU/CnD-SummerCamp21/tree/master/Week%203/The%20Road%20Ahead/The%20Model%20Predictive%20Control%20(MPC)). I have given a comprehensive explanation of a MPC controller for the Controls and Dynamics robotics summer camp 2021.
# Visualisation and Results
Here the pendulum is starting from a stable equilibrium (Theta = 0)
